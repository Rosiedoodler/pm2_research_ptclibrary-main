            <a href="https://www.springdalepubliclibrary.org" target="_blank"></a>
            <p>The landing page of the Springdale Free Public Library does well to display important information for the user, such as upcoming events. However, the site does not do well at having a balance of information in the body compared to sidebar information and decreases the use of images on sub pages. However, there is some inconsistency in the layout of several sections. The creators would do well to make the website have a consistent layout.</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>List hours the library is open along with contact information throughout website</li>
                <li>The site was made by WordPress - making it easy for the client to manage</li>
                <li>Upcoming events are listed on the landing page - this lets the user know whatâ€™s happening in the library</li>
                <li>Sidebar information throughout the site which gives the user necessary information such as hours and contact information</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The events page is not consistent on they layout - different style altogether </li>
                <li>Does not have many images throughout the site </li>
                <li>Some pages - such as the contact page - only lists the address and phone number, making the page have more information in the sidebar than on the body of the page</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://library.mercyhurst.edu" target="_blank"></a>
            <p>The website for the Mercyhurst Library has a balance of images to the body text, consistent styling of the header, and site structure. The style does change in many sections. They include different navigation, different sidebar information, and inconsistent spacing. These differences could prove confusing to the user.</p>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Consistent header style and page organization through the site</li>
                <li>Balance of images to text throughout the site</li>
                <li>Good use of spacing and balance between body content and sidebar information</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once visiting the research section, the website appears to use a new layout with more navigation with entirely different style</li>
                <li>Navigation on the research section is poorly spaced with too many links - links are responsive but on small screens, become many rows decreasing the call to action area</li>
                <li>The information in the sidebar changes throughout the website and sometimes is gone altogether</li>
            </ul>
